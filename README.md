# Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

In this repository I will discuss the various numerical solution methods of partial differential equations (PDEs).



# Lessons 

I will cover the following numerical techniques:
- Finite Differenece Methods
- Finite Element Methods
- Finite Volume Methods
- Meshless/Meshfree Methods
And in particular;
- Discontinuous galerkin Methods

# Solvers and Algorithms
- Newton Solver and so on!
- Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear Equations
- Preconditioner (transformation)
- Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) and Geometric Multigrid (GMG) methods 
- Domain Decompositon Methods (Overlapping and Non-overlapping)

#  Linearization Methods

# Model problem
- Convection equation
- Convectionâ€“Diffusion equation
- Navier-Stokes Equation
